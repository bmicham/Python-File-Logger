# Python_File_Logger
***No longer will send emails due to Gmail removing the allow unsafe apps back in May 2022.***

Logs files name, creation time and size in a directory and puts them into a CSV file.
Uses a bat to automatically run the program through Windows at timed intervals. Has the ability to sort out subtitle files (.srt, .idx, .sub).
This project was created as a poor mans file backup. If any of the information ever got corrupted or delted I would know what I had.
